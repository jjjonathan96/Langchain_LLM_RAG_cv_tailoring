## General CV
You will need to provide the general CV, which contains sections like Summary, Experience, Projects, and Skills.

## Job Description
This input would typically be a job description document or text outlining the role requirements, responsibilities, and qualifications.

## Keywords Extraction
From the job description, we can extract relevant keywords such as skills, qualifications, and technologies required for the role.
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract these keywords. LangChain can assist here by combining embeddings and LLMs to extract contextually relevant keywords and terms from the job description.

## Tailored CV
Based on the job description and the extracted keywords, the system will tailor your CV by highlighting relevant experience, skills, and projects that align with the job role.
This could involve updating the summary, emphasizing the most relevant skills, and ensuring that your experience aligns with the keywords from the job description.

## ATS Check
The system can include a step for an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) check, where it ensures that the tailored CV is compatible with automated ATS tools.
ATS tools look for specific keywords and formats in the CV, so this step would ensure that your tailored CV uses the right language, keywords, and formatting.
For an open-source ATS check, you can use a library or service like pyATS or similar to simulate the process.
